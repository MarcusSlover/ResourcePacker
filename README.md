# ResourcePacker
ðŸ“¦ Aimed to easily create Minecraft resource packs with new custom items and blocks.</br>
</br>
Currently supports:
- [x] Custom blocks
- [x] Custom items
- [x] Custom items in item frames
- [ ] Custom models (wip)

## How to use it?
There are **two ways** you can use this software in.
### ðŸŽ¯ 1. Direct Jar Executing
After you download the software, put it in a separate folder and create two directories:
`Output` and `Resources`. </br>
Your folder should look like shown below:</br>

> Make sure you set it up correctly because the program will not work properly without them.</br>
> When you're done setting up everything, run the program to build your resource pack.
#### ðŸ§­ Output Directory
It's the place where your resource pack will be available after the building process.</br>

#### ðŸ§° Resources Directory
This directory *feeds* the program with all needed images for the generation of your resource pack.</br>
It splits into **three specific groups** of textures.
- blocks - textures for custom blocks
- itemframes - textures for items that are meant to be displayed in an item frame
- items - textures for custom items</br>

When you execute the software for the first time, these directories should be generated for you automatically.</br>
After that, you may insert your textures there and run the program to your resource pack.</br>

### ðŸ’» 2. IDE Executing
You may also clone the repository and manualy build your resource pack by executing the program in your IDE.</br>

Just remember to prepare a valid setting to run the application without errors.</br>
We need them because we have to specify the path to [Output](#-output-directory) and [Resources](#-resources-directory) directories.</br>
Here's a quick tutorial on how to set it up in **IntelliJ IDEA**:</br>
> 1. Edit the configurations </br> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38810661/132091028-7c655663-8412-4fce-975e-2d687b46dfd2.png)
> 2. Create new application </br> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38810661/132091079-58258bb4-2dd3-4efc-ae40-82b88d59b93f.png)
> 3. Set up **Build and run** </br> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38810661/132091100-20df55fa-e536-4829-b7c2-02aaae1e5869.png)
</br>The main class stays as `me.marcusslover.resourcepacker.core.internal.Core`,
however, your CLI arguments must meet your exact expectations. Use `-r` argument to specify path to the [Resources](#-resources-directory) directory
and use the `-o` argument to specify path to the [Output](#-output-directory) directory. </br>
The paths must be valid otherwise the program won't be working properly. </br>
Example: `-r C:\Users\Mark\Desktop\CoolResourcePack\Resources -o C:\Users\Mark\Desktop\CoolResourcePack\Output`


When you're done setting it up, you can go ahead and do some configuration to your resource pack.</br>
Choosing to run the code yourself allows you to customize more things.</br>
Example of features you may modify:
- Name of your resource pack
- Description of your resource pack
- Usage of textures (custom registration)

That can be done in the `ResourcePacker.class`
```java
public class ResourcePacker implements IResourcePacker {

    @Override
    public void pack(RPPacker RPPacker) {
        /*Information for the build*/
        RPPacker.setPrefix("marcusslover");
        RPPacker.setName("Packer");
        RPPacker.setDescription(List.of("Generated by ResourcePacker"));
        RPPacker.setMode(RPMode.MANUAL_REGISTRATION); // Manual registration of files.

        /*Resources*/
        ResourceHelper r = RPPacker.resources();

        /*Blocks*/
        RPBlockRegistry b = RPPacker.blocks();
        b.register(RPBlock.of("Dark Tile", r.get("dark_tile.png")));
    }
}
```
Then just run your custom run configuration and enjoy your resource pack.</br>
Your final built should be in the [Output](#-output-directory) directory that you specified the path to.
